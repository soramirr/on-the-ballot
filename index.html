    <p>We believe that there is a fundamental issue with the presidential election system, and therefore we believe that changes must be made. The current election system is dominated by the two major political parties - the Republicans and Democrats. Above you can see two buttons; each will bring you to a proposed solution. While these may not completely fix the issue on their own, they are only meant to be the first step in a long journey to a more fair election system.</p>

  <div class="petition-content">
    <p>The plan here is to create a federal law requiring all states to follow the same process for allowing political parties a position on the ballot. As it currently stands, each state has its own laws regarding this - some require a petition, some a fee, others just some paperwork, and yet even more with stricter and stranger loops for candidates to jump through. Without a large team behind them, these candidates struggle to make it on more than a small handful of ballots. By creating a universal law that sets the method of getting onto a ballot, the United States government could make it far easier for smaller political parties to get through this crucial step in getting their voices heard.</p>
    <h1 class="breaker-text">All states must allow a political party to hold a primary or caucus, and send the appropriate delegates to the proceeding convention, provided the political party submits a petition with signatures more than or equal to 1% of the total registered voters in the state.</h1>

    <p class="after-iframe">As it stands, the presidential election is dominated by the Republican and Democratic parties. Every other party is left behind in the dust, primarily because they cannot even begin to get their names out there. By making it easier for parties as a whole to get primaries or caucuses in multiple states, they have a chance at at least beginning their campaigns.</p>
    <p>While this may not make our next presidential race suddenly be between a Green Party candidate and a Libertarian, this proosal is the first step in the road to giving these smaller parties a voice. The current system as a whole for electing government officials is entirely focused on a two party system, and therefore there will have to be other significant changes made, most notably to the electoral college. These changes can take many different forms, each completely unique from the previous. This, however, is far outside the scope of this project, and would likely not be implemented until around a decade after this policy, so as to avoid crippling the election system too greatly. This policy alone will be enough to at least give these smaller parties a voice whilst the rest of the system is put into place.</p>

  <div class="fourty-five">
    <p>The United States Government should switch from a two party system to a true multi party system allowing more parties actually get on the ballot. The United States claims that it allows for more than one party to get on the ballot, but as you can clearly see for the current election in order to be seen as a serious candidate you have fall into one of the two political category Democrat or Republican. We have a socialist running as a democrat and a confused man running as a republican.</p>
    <h1 class="breaker-text">Every established political party may put up a front runner for every presidential and congressional election. Each political party would also be given an election account with equal funding.</h1>
    <p>The reason being is that voices are seem to be silenced out because of the money. I a candidate with very little money goes against a billionaire more than likely the poor candidate get shut out, or drowned out. The something else I would implemented would be a system that works like Isidewith.com. This system would be like the U.N. of political party. Each party will list their stance of issues from the past and future, and people who are confused/ clueless on their political can take a test that would place them. The last thing I would implement would be a new style of presidential election it would not consist of party member vs. same party member but rather party vs. party.</p>
    <p>The problem with a system that I created it implied on the people rights. The first amendment is broke because money is constituted a form of expression as reviewed in the case of Citizens United vs. EFC However, the current system breaks the 14th amendment because those who don't have much money are put to the side. Example of this is the current election many candidates have dropped out because of lack of funds. Also those who had the least amount of money in the republican debate were thrown in the second debate which wasn't given any screen time.</p>
