    <p>We believe that there is a fundamental issue with the presidential election system, and therefore we believe that changes must be made. The current election system is dominated by the two major political parties - the Republicans and Democrats. Above you can see two buttons; each will bring you to a proposed solution. While these may not completely fix the issue on their own, they are only meant to be the first step in a long journey to a more fair election system.</p>

  <div class="petition-content">
    <p>The plan here is to create a federal law requiring all states to follow the same process for allowing political parties a position on the ballot. As it currently stands, each state has its own laws regarding this - some require a petition, some a fee, others just some paperwork, and yet even more with stricter and stranger loops for candidates to jump through. Without a large team behind them, these candidates struggle to make it on more than a small handful of ballots. By creating a universal law that sets the method of getting onto a ballot, the United States government could make it far easier for smaller political parties to get through this crucial step in getting their voices heard.</p>
    <h1 class="breaker-text">All states must allow a political party to hold a primary or caucus, and send the appropriate delegates to the proceeding convention, provided the political party submits a petition with signatures more than or equal to 1% of the total registered voters in the state.</h1>

    <p class="after-iframe">As it stands, the presidential election is dominated by the Republican and Democratic parties. Every other party is left behind in the dust, primarily because they cannot even begin to get their names out there. By making it easier for parties as a whole to get primaries or caucuses in multiple states, they have a chance at at least beginning their campaigns.</p>
    <p>While this may not make our next presidential race suddenly be between a Green Party candidate and a Libertarian, this proosal is the first step in the road to giving these smaller parties a voice. The current system as a whole for electing government officials is entirely focused on a two party system, and therefore there will have to be other significant changes made, most notably to the electoral college. These changes can take many different forms, each completely unique from the previous. This, however, is far outside the scope of this project, and would likely not be implemented until around a decade after this policy, so as to avoid crippling the election system too greatly. This policy alone will be enough to at least give these smaller parties a voice whilst the rest of the system is put into place.</p>
